# Nostr Connect (NIP46)

## Description

This NIP introduces remote signing for Nostr, allowing for secure and
decentralized signing of events using a hardware device or remote signer. The
protocol enables 2-way communication between the remote signer and a Nostr
client, providing a method for private key exposure minimization and improved
security.

## State

**This library is in an ALPHA state**, things that are implemented generally work but the API will change in breaking ways.
